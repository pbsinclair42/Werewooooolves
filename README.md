# Werewolves Helper Deluxe
Made in 24 hours during HackTheBurgh, 3/14/15

As we all know, one of the most popular mini-events at MLH's hackathons are all the games of [Werewolf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_%28party_game%29).  However, it can be tricky to run these, both keeping track of who's still alive and therefore how many are needed for a majority, and coming up with inventive new ways to describe how everyone has died.  But fear not, Werewolf Helper Deluxe will solve all your problems!

Running main.py will give you a text-based user interface which will provide all the functions you need to run a game of werewolves.  At the start, you will enter every player's name, along with their character's job, and the name of the village which the werewolves have infiltrated.  You then get taken to the main menu which presents you with a list of options.  At any point throughout the game, you can see everyone who is still alive by viewing the village.  You also have the option to change anything which is incorrect here.   This is werewolves however, so of course the main functionality is the option to kill off participants as they get lynched by the village or slaughtered by the werewolves.  In the latter case, the program will also generate a lovely death message for you to tell the village.  Don't worry about repetition either, for a fixed name, job and village, there are over 34 million different messages you can be presented with!
